- Accent color: Analogous, slightly darker blue (#2980b9) to highlight key actions and elements. High contrast for important buttons and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and professional look, suitable for both headlines and body text. Large, clear font sizes for readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons in a consistent style, primarily in the primary blue color. Prefer the use of FontAwesome due to a broad range of existing symbols. Intuitive icons for easy navigation.
- Maintain a clean, well-organized layout with clear information hierarchy and good use of white space. Use grids to structure the placement of user interface elements, to make a design that 'breathes'. Guided workflows with clear step-by-step instructions.
