# Quote System Complete Restructure Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive restructure of the Equanimity quote system has been implemented to create an industry-leading, intuitive quote management experience. The system has been transformed from a monolithic single-page form into a modern, modular multi-step wizard with live preview capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### Old System Issues
- Single 865-line component (`/quotes/create/page.tsx`)
- Overwhelming form with all fields visible at once
- No visual feedback during quote creation
- Poor user experience with required/optional field confusion
- Limited calculation capabilities
- No template or revision support

### New System Architecture
