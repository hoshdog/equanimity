# Equanimity Application Functionality Status

## Last Updated: December 2024

## Overall Status: ✅ LOCALLY FUNCTIONAL

The application is now running successfully on port 3010 with all major pages loading data using a comprehensive mock data system. Firebase dependencies have been bypassed for local development.

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Authentication System
- **Status**: ✅ Working with Mock Auth
- **Implementation**: Mock authentication system bypasses Firebase entirely
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth-mock.ts`
- **Notes**: Uses localStorage for session persistence, returns mock admin user

### 2. Sidebar Navigation
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Functional
- **Features Working**:
  - Expand/collapse with toggle button
  - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+B)
  - Visual indicators for collapsed/expanded state
  - Mobile responsive behavior
- **Location**: `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`

### 3. Dashboard
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Functional
- **Features Working**:
  - All tiles are clickable and navigate to correct pages
  - Project status chart displays properly
  - Recent activity table shows mock data
  - Responsive grid layout
- **Navigation Routes**:
  - Active Projects → `/projects?status=In Progress`
  - Total Employees → `/employees`
  - Pending Approvals → `/leave`
  - Open Quotes → `/quotes?status=open`

### 4. Data Loading (All Pages)
- **Status**: ✅ All Pages Loading Mock Data
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive mock data service
- **Location**: `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
- **Pages Updated**:
  - ✅ Customers - Loading 3 mock customers
  - ✅ Projects - Loading 4 mock projects  
  - ✅ Jobs - Loading 4 mock jobs
  - ✅ Employees - Loading 4 mock employees
  - ✅ Quotes - Loading 3 mock quotes
  - ✅ Purchase Orders - Loading 2 mock POs
  - ✅ Timesheets - Loading job data for timesheet entries

### 5. Mock Data System
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Features**:
  - Realistic Australian business data (ABNs, addresses, phone numbers)
  - Proper relationships between entities (projects → jobs → timesheets)
  - Timestamps using Firebase Timestamp format
  - 500ms simulated network delay for realistic UX
- **Entities Covered**:
  - Customers/Contacts (3 records)
  - Projects (4 records with various statuses)
  - Jobs (4 records linked to projects)
  - Employees (4 records with roles)
  - Quotes (3 records with different statuses)
  - Purchase Orders (2 records)
  - Timesheets (3 sample entries)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Mock Firebase Integration
- **Location**: `src/lib/mock-firebase.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Intercepts all Firebase calls
  - Returns mock data instead of making network requests
  - Maintains Firebase-compatible API surface
  - Supports onSnapshot, getDocs, getDoc, addDoc, updateDoc, deleteDoc

### Environment Configuration
```env
ENABLE_FIREBASE_AUTH=false
ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=true
MIGRATION_MODE=true
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### 1. Form Submissions
- **Status**: Not Connected
- **Issue**: Create/Edit forms exist but don't persist data
- **Workaround**: Forms will show success toasts but data won't be saved

### 2. Real-time Updates
- **Status**: Simulated Only
- **Issue**: No WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- **Workaround**: Page refresh required to see any "changes"

### 3. Authentication Features
- **Status**: Bypassed
- **Issue**: No real login/logout functionality
- **Workaround**: Always logged in as mock admin user

### 4. Search & Filtering
- **Status**: UI Present, Logic Missing
- **Issue**: Search boxes and filters don't actually filter data
- **Workaround**: All data always visible

## 🚀 RUNNING THE APPLICATION

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Application will run on http://localhost:3010
# (Port may vary if 3000-3009 are in use)
```

## 📝 NEXT STEPS FOR FULL FUNCTIONALITY

### Phase 1: Database Integration
1. Set up Supabase or alternative backend
2. Migrate mock data schema to real database
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Connect forms to database operations

### Phase 2: Business Logic
1. Implement CRUD operations for all entities
2. Add search and filtering functionality
3. Implement real-time subscriptions
4. Add data validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Missing Features
1. Implement Leave management system
2. Build Payroll processing
3. Create Scheduling calendar
4. Add Invoicing functionality
5. Build Inventory tracking
6. Implement Compliance tracking
7. Add Training management

### Phase 4: Production Ready

5. Configure production environment
6. Implement monitoring and analytics

## 🎉 SUMMARY

The application is now successfully running locally with mock data, providing a solid foundation for testing UI/UX and demonstrating functionality to stakeholders. All critical pages are loading data properly, and the navigation system is fully functional. The next phase would involve connecting to a real backend service (Supabase recommended based on previous analysis) to enable full CRUD operations and real-time features.

**Current Development URL**: http://localhost:3010
